# Subd_recon
This tool is created as a part of learning shell scripting, now I am making various changes to make it a better tool which can be used to collect various information of a website.

# Current features

- can test alive subdomains
- can sort out these subdomains

$ git clone https://github.com/arms636/Subd_recon.git
